#Fetching a Fibonacci

##Approach
I started off writing a test for this. The only test that I think of was making sure that the number input returned the correct answer. Since the program is fairly simple, I didn't worry too much about writing a bunch of tests. I had already dealt with this problem in the past. There are plenty of resources on this on Google.
